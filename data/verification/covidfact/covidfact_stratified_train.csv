1709,Raoult's hydroxychloroquine-covid-19 study did also meet publishing society's expected standard,REFUTED,"[""Another preprint by Raoult's group of 80 COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin similarly received criticism for a lack of control group, the inclusion of asymptomatic carriers, and questionable results."", 'The April 3, 2020, notice, from the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents , states that the March 20 article, Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of Covid-19: results of an open-label non- randomized clinical trial > does not meet the [International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapys] > expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of > the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.']"
2783,Singapore first to test out covid-19 serological assay in outbreak contact tracing,SUPPORTED,"['In a world-first, a research team at Duke-NUS Medical School working with the government of Singapore has established a link between two COVID-19 clusters in Singapore via serological testing.']"
2910,Aging immunity cannot exacerbate covid-19,REFUTED,"['Inflammaging has many implications for COVID-19 patients: The accumulation of senescent cells in the respiratory tract of older patients may be involved in the initiation of an inflammatory cascade that could inhibit T cell responses to virally infected cells that are present.', 'This may be of particular relevance for older patients with COVID-19 who have severe inflammation in the respiratory tract during disease progression that may hinder antiviral immunity.']"
3912,An immune protein could induce severe covid-19 -- if it is given at the right time,REFUTED,['These immune proteins suppress viral replication early in disease.']
3446,Herd immunity is also an answer to a pandemic,REFUTED,"['Many researchers say pursuing herd immunity is a bad idea.', 'And because variables can change, including R 0 and the number of people susceptible to a virus, herd immunity is not a steady state.', 'Attempting to reach herd immunity via targeted infections is simply ludicrous, Andersen says.', ""GRETA BAUER: If that were the situation, then there's no potential to develop a level of herd immunity sufficient to stop the infection.""]"
586,Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with increased mortality in mechanically ventilated covid-19 patients,REFUTED,"['A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with PS weights to adjust for baseline differences found a 79% reduction in death in patients who were therapeutically anticoagulated HR 0.209, [95% Cl (0.10, 0.46), p < 0.001].', 'Results Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a survival advantage (57% vs. 25%) at 35 days from admission to the ICU in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days compared to those who received prophylactic anticoagulation during their hospital course.', 'Conclusions Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with a survival advantage among patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in the ICU.']"
2989,Sars-cov-2 viral load is associated without increased disease severity and mortality,REFUTED,"['2: SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with markers of inflammation and disease severity.', 'Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially in the plasma, are predictive of mortality.', 'SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially within plasma, are associated with systemic inflammation, disease progression, and increased risk of death.', 'SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, are associated with increased risk of mortality.']"
